# fixedincomecalculator

A quick and easy-to-use tool for tracking the interest income from coupon payments each year and calculating the return on investment (ROI) of a fixed-income security, such as a bond, based on the face value/principal amount, simple interest rate, years to maturity, and coupon frequency of the investment. 

This tool also provides an option to calculate the inflation-adjusted ROI based on compounded inflation.

Disclaimer: this tool assumes that the fixed-income security will be held until maturity and is bought for face value, not at a discount price. Therefore, the tool does not account for changes in the market price of the security over the years.
